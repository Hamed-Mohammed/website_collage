                <p>The college was established in 2002, under the name  ‘College of Information Technology’, to become the  core of the information technology field in Iraq. To stay updated with scientific and cognitive development in this area, specialized staff able to keep up with the rapid changes in the field were prepared. In 2005 and  as a result of the rapid development and convergence of information and communication, college council had found that it was necessary to modify the college’s name to ‘College of Information Engineering’. The expansion of it’s specialties included information and communication technologies, it also had modified academic programs for the college under it’s new perspective. The College is seeking to raise the level of teaching and research and to link it to the needs of the local and regional environment, as well as the dissemination of knowledge and the promotion of research collaboration with local, regional and international institutions.</p>
